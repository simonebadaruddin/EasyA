To run the web scraper, these will need to be installed first: 
	    pip install requests
        pip install html5lib
        pip install bs4

After these are installed, program can be ran

Since it just returns a list, there should be nothing output however there is a test.py in the files that shows how to use the WebScraper in another python file

'''
from WebScraper import return_faculty_list

get_faculty_list = return_faculty_list()

# print(get_faculty_list)
print('done')
'''
