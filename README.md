# EasyA
a system called EasyA that students can use to figure out which professors in which classes are giving the most As, and which professors are giving the fewest Ds or Fs.

Graded on:

## Initial Project Plan
- A management plan. How is your team organized? How is the work divided among team members? How does your team make decisions? How will your team meet and how will it communicate.
-   Work breakdown schedule (with > 10 milestones) and project schedule (who will do what).
- Monitoring and reporting: How individual and project progress will be monitored to keep track of who did what and when did they do it?
- A build plan. What is the sequence of steps you will take to build the system? When will each "build" of the system take place
- A rationale for the build plan. Why have you broken the system into these parts, and why have you chosen these particular steps to build the system? What are your risks and your risk reduction strategies?

## SRS
- Problem statement - Clear and concisely, what is the problem to be solved? The problem, including the task requirements, should be described independently of the solution, the piece of software you will build.
- Description of User - Who are the users? What will they expect? What will they know already? What are their current technology usage patterns?
- Scenarios or Use Cases - Three specific, different, realistic scenarios.
- Detailed Description of Requirements - Expand the problem statement and generalize from the use cases. Include at least 20 specific and measurable requirements. At least 6 should be non-functional requirements.
- Both functional and non-functional requirements should be split between absolutely required and not absolutely required requirements. A reasonable number of absolutely required requirements are identified, well-specified but attainable.

### SDS 
- A description of the product you intend to build. This should describe the externally visible behavior of your product as precisely as possible, but it should be concise and clear.
- An overall design description. What are the major parts of your system, and how do they fit together?
- System structure is clear.
- Each major subsystem should be explained using a separate static model and dynamic model. All diagrams must be clear and understandable.
- Design Rationale. Why did you chose this particular design? What are the main organizing principles that you used to break your system into parts?
